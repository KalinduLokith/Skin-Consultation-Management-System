This project is implemented to develop a program that implements a system to manage a Skin Consultation Centre. 


The coursework is divided into four phases, each with specific tasks to complete. Here is a breakdown of the coursework tasks:

Phase 1 - Design and classes implementation:

Design a UML use case diagram for the system.
Design a UML class diagram for the system.
Implement the classes Person, Doctor, Patient, and Consultation.
Implement the interface WestminsterSkinConsultationManager.

Phase 2 - Console menu implementation:

Implement a console menu in the WestminsterSkinConsultationManager class.
Implement methods to add a new doctor, delete a doctor, print the list of doctors, and save the information to a file.

Phase 3 - GUI implementation:

Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for the system.
Display the list of doctors with their information.
Allow the user to select a doctor and add a consultation.
Allow the user to enter patient details, choose a date/time for the consultation, add cost information, and add notes.

Phase 4 - Testing and system validation:

Write a test plan to ensure the system works as expected.
Implement automated unit tests for each functionality.
Evaluate the robustness of the code, error handling, and input validation.
Evaluate the quality of the code and adherence to coding standards and conventions.
